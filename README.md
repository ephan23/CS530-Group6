# Slot Machine Simulator - CS530 Group 6

The Slot Machine Simulator is a hardware prototype which interfaces with an LCD screen, coin acceptor, 2 buttons, and 9 LEDs using Python.

# How to use

1. Enter quarters into coin acceptor.
2. When ready, press the Start button to roll.
3. The program randomly generates 3 numbers between 1-3 and reflects them onto the 9 LEDs.

- If 3 LEDs match, player receives 2.0x their initial bet.
- If 2 LEDs match, player receives 1.5x their initial bet.
- If no LEDs match, the player doesn't receive a payout.

4. When prompted, press the Start button to play again or Exit button to end play.
